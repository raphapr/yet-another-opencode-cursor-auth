# Restored Cursor CLI Source

This directory contains the restored source code for the Cursor CLI, extracted from the Webpack bundle.

## Structure

- `src/`: The main application source code.
- `node_modules/`: Restored dependencies.

## Usage

You can explore the `src/` directory to understand the CLI's logic. Note that the code still contains Webpack-specific calls like `__webpack_require__`.
