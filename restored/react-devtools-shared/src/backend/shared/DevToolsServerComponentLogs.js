// This keeps track of Server Component logs which may come from.

// but can become associated with a Virtual Instance of any renderer.
// This keeps it around as long as the ComponentInfo is alive which
// lets the Fiber get reparented/remounted and still observe the previous errors/warnings.
// Unless we explicitly clear the logs from a Fiber.
